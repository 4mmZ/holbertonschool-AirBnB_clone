## About

The purpose of this project is that us students are able to apply all the knowledge we got from Holberton's higher lever proggraming track in a much bigger scope than we are used to. The project itself its divided in five parts scattered around the span of four months:
-   A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging).
-   A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic.
-   A database or files that store data (data = objects).
-   An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).
